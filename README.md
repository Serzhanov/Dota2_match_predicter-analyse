# Dota2_match_predicter-analyse

Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero". There are currently 122 possible heroes to choose from, each with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.

There are many different aspects of a match that contribute to the outcome of either a win or a loss. This analysis focuses on using various machine learning algorithms to create a model based on data collected within all information during the match of a high-ranking Dota2 match which as accurately as possible predicts the outcome of the match. Based on the resulting models, we will identify what elements of the game have the highest impact on the outcome of a match.

# Data Understanding
The data we will use to perform this analysis was obtained from this Kaggle dataset .This dataset contains 50000 ranked ladder matches from the Dota 2 data dump created by Opendota. 
The aim of this dataset is to enable the exploration of player behavior, skill estimation, or anything you find interesting. The intent is to create an accessible, and easy to use resource, which can be expanded and modified if needed. As such I am open to a wide variety of suggestions as to what additions or changes to make.
